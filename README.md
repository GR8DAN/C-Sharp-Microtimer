# C-Sharp-Microtimer

Code for a C# Microtimer for high speed events using the .NET Stopwatch and BackgroundWorker.

See the online article [High Speed Regular Events in C Sharp](https://tekeye.uk/visual_studio/high-speed-regular-events-in-c-sharp "Microsecond events in C#").

This C# solution is a demo of executing code at regular intervals at high speed. Faster than using a WinForms Timer class. The demo is a dice simulator. On a Windows PC with a i7-4770 3.4 Ghz processor the dice simulator was performing 98,000 dice rolls per second, thus close to a 10 microsecond regular event.
